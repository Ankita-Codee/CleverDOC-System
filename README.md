# 🧠 Clever Doc System

## 🔍 Overview / Use Case
**Clever Doc System** is an **LLM-powered intelligent document analysis platform** that combines **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with **large language models (LLMs)** to perform deep document understanding, comparison, and visualization.

Users can:
- Upload multiple documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.)
- Query any uploaded file using natural language
- Compare two files to find similarities, differences, or contextual updates

💡 **Real-World Example:**
A **legal or compliance team** can upload multiple versions of a contract. The system automatically identifies and summarizes the clause changes, deadline updates, or modified obligations.  
Similarly, **researchers** can compare policy drafts or technical reports to track changes and insights over time.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview
1. **User Interface:** Upload files and submit queries or comparisons  
2. **Backend (FastAPI):** Handles file management, embeddings, and query logic  
3. **RAG Engine:** Retrieves contextually relevant chunks from Pinecone  
4. **LLM Layer (OpenAI):** Generates summaries, differences, and answers  
5. **Image Generator (Azure AI Foundry):** Creates visual summaries or creative outputs  
6. **Storage Layer:** Stores embeddings and processed data (Pinecone + AWS)  
7. **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated testing and deployment via GitHub Actions
